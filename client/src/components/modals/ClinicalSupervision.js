                                supervision. My Diploma in Supervision was
                                awarded by The Institute of Group Analysis. I
                                have experience supervising trainees, qualified
                                practitioners, and people working with a

                                psychodynamic.

                                jointly researching about the experience of

                                reflective supervisory space to ensure that
                                supervision is dynamic, challenging, supporting,
                                and motivating for yourself and your clients.

                                Supervision is an essential component of the
                                ongoing professional development of
                                practitioners. The primary purpose of
                                supervision is to throw light on the
                                relationship between the client and practitioner
                                and maintain high standards of care. Supervision
                                fosters ongoing growth and development and is
                                valuable for providing your clients with
                                effective, ethical, and culturally responsive
                                care.

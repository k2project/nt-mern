            <p>
                A glance at the news might convince us to that ours is an era of
                social atomisation and isolation, with recurrent reports of a
                loneliness epidemic and of teenagers and adults glued to
                smartphones, socialising almost exclusively online. Yet, as the
                growth of self-help groups built by individuals around specific
                issues or identities – from safe spaces for trans, non-binary or
                neurodivergent people to the Men in Sheds movement – suggests,
                the social instinct is alive and well, perhaps all the more so
                as society recovers from the trauma of COVID and its lockdowns.
            </p>
            <p>
                If individuals want to get together to talk socially about
                subjects that might ordinarily be talked about privately,
                because doing so is (in the truest sense of the word)
                therapeutic, it might seem self-evident that psychotherapy and
                one of its key innovations – group therapy – has a special role
                today and one that is changing as society evolves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Group therapy is, after all, a relatively young modality, which
                has matured as its parent discipline has expanded and
                diversified. In 1970, the year before the Institute for Group
                Analysis was founded in London, Carl Rogers reckoned that the
                ‘planned, intensive group experience’ was the most potent
                invention of the century.1 Only a couple of decades before, Kurt
                Lewin’s ‘T-groups’ effectively birthed group therapy in 1947.
                Writing on group psychology a few decades earlier, Sigmund Freud
                highlighted humans’ intrinsically social nature, and how ‘in the
                individual’s mental life someone else is invariably involved, as
                a model, as an object, as a helper, as an opponent’.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what is the state of play with group therapy right now? We
                asked five practitioners about the relevance and direction of
                group therapy today and how it is responding and adapting to
                social changes.

                ‘Group work is about modelling the benefits of prosocial
                relationships. Groups can be a powerful therapy for special
                populations,’ according to UKCP integrative psychotherapist
                Nujoji Calvocoressi, who runs a long-term, high-intensity
                programme for female offenders in the democratic therapeutic
                community at HMP Send.

            <h4 className='article-subtitle'>UNDERSTANDING THEIR PATH</h4>
            <p>
                ‘Women in the group are in custody for homicide, manslaughter
                and violent offences such as grievous bodily harm (GBH), and
                often present with borderline or antisocial personality
                disorder. The aim for them, over 18 months to three years, is to
                understand how killing someone became the best or only option at
                the time, and to make sense by understanding their perpetrator
                path or their path to being a victim from a very young age.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘The groups are held twice a week with one other co-facilitator,
                a prison officer or forensic psychologist. Residents are also
                encouraged to participate in community aspects such as taking
                jobs, and to live in an environment that, as far as possible,
                equalises the power differential between staff and prisoners.
                This group work is about modelling the benefits of prosocial
                relationships – to understand how they come to be sitting in
                this group with me in prison, and what has gone before that
                influenced their decisions. It’s slow, steady work that’s very
                rewarding, but it’s hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘The clients are very damaged people and are a cross-section of
                society, often with entrenched histories of addiction. We tend
                to have the extreme of things in prison – issues are more
                visible and easier to detect – whereas in the community, someone
                might have a job and a partner and it might be harder to
                identify these things. We work relationally and we have to be
                careful about dynamics such as splitting, manipulation and
                special relationships. We always have two staff to one resident,
                so we get a balanced perspective of what’s going on.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘The prison service is very pro group therapy, because most
                personality disorder groups come about because of the urgent
                need for perspective. As a psychotherapist, I have multiple
                loyalties – to the group members, the prison, the parole board
                and to protecting the public from harm if these women are
                released. I’m always on my toes and have to think cleverly and
                fast, often while under fire. When you’re running a group with
                members whose problem-solving strategy is “kill”, everything
                gets killed, and too much goodness can’t be tolerated.
            </p>
            <h4 className='article-subtitle'>WHAT'S THE PRIORITY?</h4>
            <p>
                ‘We also have to acknowledge our privilege: the public’s
                priority for offender rehabilitation may not be the group
                member’s priority. There is an assumption in psychotherapy that
                people want goodness and seek happiness, rather than power or
                manipulation. Psychotherapy sometimes leans in forensic settings
                in an overly positive and perhaps, at times, gullible way. That
                slightly Pollyanna-ish approach makes assumptions that people in
                custody have a life that is recognisable to “mine” and that is
                generally not true. There is a lot of having to rework some of
                our starting points for thinking.’
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘The heart of any ideal thinking about decolonising starts with
                oneself,’ says UKCP registered integrative arts psychotherapist
                Anthea Benjamin, who advocates for group work as a powerful, but
                overlooked, modality. She works as a facilitator spanning
                organisations, student trainings, community groups and work with
                sexual abuse survivors.
            </p>
            <h4 className='article-subtitle'>LIFE DYNAMICS IN ACTION</h4>
            <p>
                ‘Historically, group work has been perceived as a poor cousin of
                individual therapy. In the NHS, there has certainly been a
                culture of privileging individual therapy. It’s a shame. In
                group therapy, you’re dealing with life dynamics in action and
                the relational patterns you’re struggling with will get
                replicated with members in the group. That gets overlooked and
                the benefit is that you get to work in a very dynamic way with
                people who may have similar patterns. You get to have more
                awareness of where you get stuck in relationships, how people
                experience you, and you get a chance to be able to move beyond
                that.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘After the pandemic, there has been a huge need to feel
                connected and part of a community, and groups have always had
                the benefit of enabling people not to feel alone. People will
                often come into groups thinking there is something wrong with
                them, or that they weren’t given the book about how to do
                relationships, and then they realise that it’s part of being
                human: they’re not alone and everyone has their own version of
                this. Every member becomes a kind of co-therapist, and people
                have this dual role of being able to get what they need
                developmentally, as well as realising that they themselves have
                wisdom, skill and insight.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘There has also been a lot of thinking about how we decolonise
                our practice, thinking about power, provision and position, the
                blind spots where in groups some norms can lead to the
                replication of marginalisation and harm. These issues need
                constant attention and we need to be really aware of what the
                representations in the room are in terms of identity, and
                therefore what becomes the dominant culture and narrative. We
                challenge and question that, thinking about who is on the
                margins and, as facilitators, we need to be active.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Traditionally, there has been an idea that you sit back and let
                the group do the work, but what we know now is that that allows
                harms to be replicated. We need to be vigilant and use our
                authority to think about how people get things projected into
                them again and again, what the majority culture may be in the
                group, and how there may be scapegoating.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘At the heart of any ideal thinking about decolonising any
                curriculum, or culture or practice is oneself – the facilitators
                doing their own work of decolonising themselves (which is a
                life’s work) so that they are able to be sensitive. We all come
                with our own positionalities, so it’s important to listen and
                when you hear a marginalised voice or experience, you don’t
                negate it or fall back into thinking about things from a
                comfortable internal world context. These issues are important
                for people at the hard end of society.’
            </p>
            <h4 className='article-subtitle'>THE IMPORTANCE OF GROWTH</h4>
            <p>
                ‘Groups need to feel like they will be growthful for people to
                be drawn to them,’ believes UKCP humanistic psychotherapist Tim
                Foskett, who has run group work sessions for bisexual and gay
                men for more than 20 years, and sees the growth of social
                justice movements as symbiotically linked with the expansion of
                group therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Gay/bi men often grow up in isolation, with strong messages of
                disgust, illness and the potential for rejection. The culture
                may be changing, but the damage to our self-esteem was often
                done decades ago – and it’s still being done to the self-esteem
                of many young queer people. Gay/ bi men who experience other
                forms of discrimination or oppression, such as racism, HIV-ism,
                ageism or ableism, often experience even greater
                marginalisation. So, to come together in a therapy group offers
                enormous potential for learning about yourself and others and
                how you interrelate. The opportunities for bonding, for support
                and for connection outside the commercial gay scene – which
                often has a focus on objectification, competition and the use of
                alcohol and drugs to facilitate forming what are sometimes
                transient connections with others – are significant, potentially
                healing, life- affirming and refreshing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Irvin Yalom proposed a range of “therapeutic factors” that made
                good group experiences psychotherapeutic: normalisation (of
                what’s really going on for human beings); universality
                (realising we are all dealing with the universal issues of
                life); cohesion (the feeling of being connected and part of
                something); and identification (recognising yourself in another
                person’s story; developing a bond with one or more group
                members). These are powerful experiences for any human being in
                mental distress, but the factors have a particular impact on
                people from marginalised communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Social justice movements have been important players in the
                development of group therapy, at least as much as group therapy
                has contributed to social justice. Feminist
                consciousness-raising groups of the 1960s and 1970s are one such
                example, along with Kurt Lewin’s early work with groups in the
                Deep South of the USA on issues of race and racism.
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Most social justice movements, including LGBTQ+ communities and
                disability communities, have self-organised sharing and
                consciousness- raising spaces for decades, and this is clearly
                happening now with trans and non-binary people and those who are
                neurodiverse. So many movements have been born this way – people
                who share an identity or experience when finding each other,
                then build connections and safety and share their stories.
                Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-step programmes are another example
                of a movement that has both informed, as well as been informed
                by, group therapy thinking.’

                ‘Groups offer opportunities for people to experience themselves

                gestalt, integrative and body psychotherapist Carmen Joanne
                Ablack, director of psychotherapy at The Gestalt Centre, who
                argues that group work offers important possibilities for

                year groups from our training programmes, plus all the tutors –
                around 120 people. This large group becomes a reflection of the
                wider society and students learn how to speak up and how to
                express themselves in the large group setting. We see this as a
                pivotal part of the training. We’re moving all the time from
                experiencing, to theory, to practice – linking all three
                together, and it’s true to the gestalt idea of paying attention
                to what emerges in the here and now.

            <p>
                ‘Underlying all our group work is equality, diversity and
                inclusion, paying attention to all the different identity
                processes people may have and the intersections of those. This
                leads to an embodied understanding of the ethics and
                responsibilities functioning in the therapeutic realm. Students
                have an embodied, lived experience of: “How do I manage to say
                things to the ‘other’?”; “How do I manage to express my
                difference, while acknowledging the other’s difference?”. We see
                the group work as a very important part of the learning process.

                ‘Groups offer opportunities for people to experience themselves
                in their bodies and in relation to others, and what matters is
                that they are supported in what they find. Group work is one of
                the places where you really learn as a participant that it’s

                ‘Groups are the way to go,’ urges UKCP psychoanalytic and group-
                analytic psychotherapist Kevin Power. He advocates for
                psychodynamic group therapy as the solution to the UK and the
                NHS’s crisis in psychological distress. The only way that NHS
                and the nation en masse might ever get to grips with the crisis
                in psychological distress is to employ a huge number of
                well-qualified and experienced group- analytic psychotherapists.

                all justified”. I ran three analytic groups across two days,
                weekly, for 20 years within the Kent and Medway NHS and Social
                Care Partnership Trust.

                ‘More than 80 per cent of members did not return to the Trust
                for further treatment. Placing people in group analysis puts
                them in a weekly psychodynamic interactive gathering for 90
                minutes, and they come back the next week. Each and all have
                separate agendas, but over weeks and months each realises that
                the group offers help in a very different way to the individual
                situation, one that engages them in a confidential exploratory
                dialogue between members that brings on change first and which
                is then followed by insight into their condition.

                ‘Those tormented by sexual abuse, abandonment, rejection,
                suicide and attachment concerns all get to realise that they are
                not alone, that their lives are similar in some respects to
                others while contrasting with others also.

                ‘For Trusts, this is much more economic than individual
                situations; everybody participates in an in-depth therapy over
                several years. Groups, then, are the way to go. A recent joiner
                of a private group I run said bemusedly a few weeks ago, “They
                say that the country is going through a mental health crisis...
                this looks to me like the solution”.’

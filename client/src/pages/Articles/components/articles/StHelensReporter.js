            <p>
                Child sexual exploitation by organised networks in St Helens is
                set to be examined by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual
                Abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Public hearings taking place from September 21 to October 2 will
                analyse the current nature and extent of the issue across
                England and Wales, as well as institutional responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The investigation will focus on separate areas, which also
                include Swansea, Durham, Bristol and Warwickshire. These regions
                have been chosen because they represent a range of sizes,
                demographics and institutional practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                It will assess the extent to which authorities have learned
                lessons from recent high profile cases, such as those seen in
                Rotherham, Oxford and Rochdale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Evidence will be heard from victims and survivors of child
                sexual exploitation and representatives of police forces, local
                authorities, Government departments and charities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hearing will take place virtually from 10.30am to 4.15pm. It
                will be streamed live on the Inquiry’s website and the
                transcripts will be available on the website a few hours after
                each hearing day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nujoji Calvocoressi, a member of the Inquiry’s Victims and
                Survivors Consultative Panel, said: “It is clear that the
                grooming and sexual abuse of children by groups of offenders is
                an urgent problem across England and Wales.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This hugely important investigation will examine the current
                strategies in places including St Helens to prevent this type of
                child sexual exploitation and see what more can be done in
                future.”

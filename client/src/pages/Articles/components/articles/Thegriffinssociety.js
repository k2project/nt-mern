                I am particularly interested in understanding the tensions that
                exist in prisons between care versus control and inclusion
                versus exclusion.

            <p>
                I work as a psychotherapist in Europe’s only women’s prison
                based Democratic Therapeutic Community (DTC). This is an
                accredited group-based offender behaviour programme delivered
                via the Offender Personality Disorder Pathway. Prior to this I
                have worked as a psychotherapist in the men’s prison estate. In
                addition, I have consulted to the Independent Inquiry into Child
                Sexual Abuse and contributed to the Inquiry’s work about child
                sexual abuse in custodial settings. I have also served for ten
                years in the voluntary sector as a Justice of the Peace in both
                the Adult and Youth Magistrate’s Courts.

                My Masters dissertation was a small-scale thematic analysis
                about the experience of psychotherapist’s working in two men’s
                prison, I explored some of the difficulties and challenges that
                impact the efficacy of psychotherapy in the setting. I am
                particularly interested in understanding the tensions that exist
                in prisons between care versus control and inclusion versus
                exclusion.

                The work that takes place in the women’s DTC is hugely
                under-studied and the Fellowship programme offers a wonderful
                opportunity to advance knowledge about women convicted of the
                most serious offences by informing practice and influencing
                policy. I will be undertaking the research study with my
                colleague and Fellow, Sophie Crilly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our research study will explore the experience of former DTC
                participants who have successfully completed the intervention
                and remain in custody serving the remainder of their sentence.
                We are interested in the sense the participants have made of
                their experience of the DTC since leaving and returning to a
                typical prison location.

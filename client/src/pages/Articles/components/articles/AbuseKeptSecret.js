                New research also finds that almost half of victims suffer from
                a long-term condition.
            </p>
            <p className='article-subtitle'>
                The majority – two-thirds – of child sexual abuse survivors in
                the UK did not tell anyone about the abuse they suffered at the
                time that they experienced it, according to research published
                by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA).
            </p>
            <p>
                The IICSA was set up in 2014 in the wake of the investigations
                into Jimmy Saville – the deceased TV and radio personality who
                was found to have abused dozens of children throughout his
                career – and other high-profile cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inquiry’s remit is to investigate cases and the systemic
                issues that led to child sexual abuse over a period of decades.
                The inquiry’s Truth Project, also launched in 2014, focuses on
                how organisations failed to protect children from sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the study based on 5,104 accounts sent to the Truth
                Project, abusers often told their victims that they would not be
                believed, would get into trouble, or would be sent away. The
                research paints a picture of both the experience of abuse and
                its long-term impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nearly nine in ten victims said their experiences impacted their
                mental health, with more than a third saying they experienced
                depression. Over half said their relationships had been
                affected, and four in ten said the same of their
                schooling/employment. Overall, nearly half of survivors have an
                illness or condition that still affects their daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IICSA and the Truth Project published 80 personal accounts
                from survivors as part of their research. One respondent, Denny,
                spent time in a youth detention centre in the 1980s. It was “run
                on fear” and violent assaults by staff occurred daily. At the
                time, he did not come forward about the sexual abuse he suffered
                at the hands of the head gardener there because he felt he would
                be “laughed at”.
            </p>
            <p>
                A year after the abuse started he suffered a breakdown in his
                mental health and was admitted to hospital. Today, he still
                takes medication to help with his mental health. It took Denny
                27 years to report the matter to the police, after hearing that
                others had reported their experiences of abuse at the centre. He
                told the inquiry he has not heard anything since his police
                interview, and feels angry and let down.

                “This appalling finding shows more must be done to normalise the
                conversation around child sexual abuse,” said Nujoji
                Calvocoressi, a member of the Victims and Survivors Consultative
                Panel for the IICSA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of the people who shared their account of abuse with the Truth
                Project, one in ten were disclosing it for the first time in
                their lives. The largest group to come forward were adults in
                their 50s, while seven in ten were women and nine in ten were
                white.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another respondent, Joyce, told a friend at school about the
                abuse she was suffering at the hands of a sibling. The friend
                told a teacher, who then went to her parents. The family did not
                believe her and threatened to have her taken into care. “The
                abuse I suffered as a child has to a degree directly and
                indirectly impacted on every aspect of my life,” Joyce said.
                Even as an adult she says she struggles to trust anyone.

                The Truth Project is closing in 2021, but survivors who would
                like to share their experiences can still do so by phone, via a
                video call or in writing. More information about how to share
                can be found on the Truth Project website.

                “Those who have been sexually abused need to feel there is
                someone they can reach out to who will listen to them and, most
                importantly, believe them,” said Calvocoressi.

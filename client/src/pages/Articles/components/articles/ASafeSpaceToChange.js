            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>What is the DTC?</h5>

            <p>
                The Democratic Therapeutic Community (DTC) is an accredited,
                group-based intervention aimed at reducing risk by facilitating
                real, lasting change. We are a supportive environment where
                members live and work together to explore and challenge
                behaviours and attitudes which can lead to offending. We offer a
                safe space for members with complex psychological and emotional
                needs – including personality difficulties – to explore their
                histories. The service works in a way which is informed and
                equipped to manage trauma.
            </p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>
                How many women are there?
            </h5>
            <p>The DTC has spaces for 24 residents.</p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>
                How long do they stay, and where do they move on to afterwards?
            </h5>
            <p>
                Members can expect to spend between 21 months and three years at
                the DTC so they must have enough time left on their sentence.
                New members spend the first three months together in an
                assessment group, which allows them time to settle in and get
                used to sharing in groups. Before members leave the DTC they are
                supported to prepare for relocation or resettlement. Some
                members transfer to an enhanced wing, some are released, and
                some apply to progression PIPE [Psychologically-Informed Planned
                Environment].
            </p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>
                What facilities are there?
            </h5>
            <p>
                At the DTC, members are all in single cells with a toilet and
                shower. They have access to a dining hall to eat meals in, a
                large community space to associate, a library, gym with exercise
                classes and access to the gardens and outdoor space including
                their own polytunnel for growing vegetables (pictured). Members
                also have access to a kitchen.
            </p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>What is the regime like?</h5>
            <p>
                The week begins on Monday with a community meeting. This is
                where issues are discussed and decisions made that affect the
                day-to-day life of the community. On Tuesday and Thursday
                morning, residents attend their small therapy group. On
                Wednesday, residents participate in the living and learning
                space where they come together to learn new life skills in an
                informal context. On Friday the community comes together, and
                members and staff give each other feedback about their progress.
                During the afternoon, members attend art therapy, gardens, or
                attend education and work.
            </p>
            <p>
                While group therapy is an important part of the DTC, therapeutic
                processes also occur in communal spaces. In these spaces,
                members spend time together to develop healthy social
                relationships. Examples are watching films, cooking meals and
                playing games together. There is also a community breakfast held
                at the weekend.
            </p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>
                How does the ‘democratic’ aspect work?
            </h5>
            <p>
                One of the important principles underpinning the community is
                democracy. This means that as far as possible, members will have
                a voice in the day-to-day decision-making and running of the
                community. This includes voting about important decisions that
                impact community life – from what activities take place, to the
                Christmas menu.
            </p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>
                What therapy is provided?
            </h5>
            <p>
                We are a multi-disciplinary service, and our staff team reflects
                this. At the DTC, we have both operational and non-operational
                staff, all of whom participate in service delivery. During a
                member’s time on the community, they will get to know and work
                alongside our specialist officers, psychologists,
                psychotherapists, management team and civilian staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therapy takes place in smaller groups, and residents will focus
                on making links between their behaviour in prison and their
                criminal behaviour and early life experiences. This may include
                exploring relationships, unresolved family conflicts, and
                working through early traumatic experiences.
            </p>
            <h5 className='article-subtitle-small'>
                Is it only for lifers and IPPs?
            </h5>
            <p>
                We are a national service and accept referrals from across the
                women’s prison estate. Any adult woman who has been sentenced
                can apply or be referred to the DTC. Every application is
                considered on an individual basis.
            </p>

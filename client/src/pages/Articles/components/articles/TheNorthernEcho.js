            <p>
                CHILD sexual exploitation by organised networks in County Durham
                will be examined as part of an inquiry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The latest strand of The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual
                Abuse, which started today, will take evidence from victims and
                survivors of child sexual exploitation and representatives of
                police forces, local authorities, Government departments and
                charities.
            </p>
            <p>The hearings started today and will run until October 2.</p>
            <p>
                They will analyse the current nature and extent of the issue
                across England and Wales, as well as institutional responses
                including from County Durham organisations which will give
                evidence on Wednesday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Durham is one of six regions the investigation will focus on –
                the others being St Helens, Swansea, Tower Hamlets, Bristol and
                Warwickshire – which have been chosen because they represent a
                range of sizes, demographics and institutional practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inquiry will assess the extent to which authorities have
                learned lessons from recent high profile cases, such as those
                seen in Rotherham, Oxford and Rochdale.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Wednesday, the inquiry will hear from representatives of
                Durham County Council, Durham Safeguarding Children Partnership
                and Durham Constabulary about what is being done to prevent
                similar offending in the area.

                In her opening remarks this morning, lead counsel Henrietta Hill
                QC said child exploitation in England and Wales is
                under-reported.
            </p>
            <p>
                She said: “What seems clear is that cases of child sexual
                exploitation are under-reported and that the numbers of children
                affected are much higher than official records would report or
                suggest.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We know from research that the big picture is that many
                thousands of children are sexually exploited each year.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Ms Hill said police recorded 1,012 offences of abuse of children
                through sexual exploitation in 2018/19, and 5,900 offences of
                sexual grooming.
            </p>
            <p>
                The latest section of the wide-ranging IICSA will draw evidence
                from a range of complainants and organisations to assess how
                networks including grooming gangs have been able to operate.

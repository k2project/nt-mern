                        Regular weekly sessions are of 50 minutes duration, and
                        are charged at Â£95 per session. I am happy to accept

                        All therapy sessions are chargeable including the
                        initial consultation. Some therapists offer a reduced
                        fee or initial consultation at no charge. I feel the
                        first session is an important part of our work and I
                        provide the same level of service during that session as
                        all others so my charges reflect this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our initial sessions are an opportunity for us to meet
                        and explore whether therapy might be helpful to you.
                        There is no commitment to ongoing work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you decide you would like to continue, we will agree
                        on a regular day and time to meet on an ongoing basis.
                        Regular sessions are necessary to facilitate and give
                        momentum to the therapeutic process. Many people find
                        that regular meetings provide a sense of internal
                        calmness and continuity whilst they are working on their
                        emotional difficulties.

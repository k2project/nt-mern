                    isn’t about giving advice or telling people what to do.
                    Instead it is about creating a safer, calmer and non-
                    judgemental space where you can reflect, explore and
                    understand the difficulties in your life. The insight and
                    awareness you gain can in itself feel freeing allowing you
                    more choice in the way you live your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Counselling and psychotherapy can bring new levels of
                    awareness that makes life feel easier to manage opening up
                    the possibility of more choice and ways to be in the world.
                    There is good evidence-based research that counselling and
                    psychotherapy can be helpful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is my experience that counselling and psychotherapy is a
                    collaborative process and the more you engage with the
                    process the more you are likely to benefit from it. There
                    are many ways in which I believe counselling and
                    psychotherapy helps. Being able to talk things through with
                    a trained professional, someone other than your friends or
                    family, can bring a sense of relief. We often hide our
                    feelings from those closest to us because of our feelings of
                    shame, fear of judgement and a wish not to burden others.

                    strands of specific therapeutic modalities. Integrative
                    therapists take the view that no one approach can reach each
                    client in all situations. Rather, each person needs to be
                    thought about as an individual and counselling and

                    Some people face specific challenges to obtaining effective
                    therapy or their experiences in the past have felt
                    oppressive. Sometimes people feel they were not viewed
                    positively or clumsy assumptions were made about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my practice I attempt to work in a way that appreciates,
                    affirms and values individual identities, backgrounds,
                    sameness and difference. My intention is to be an
                    anti-oppressive, inclusive therapist and to develop an
                    understanding of your unique experience.

                There is no scale of importance, you don't have to be in crisis
                to make use of therapy. The most important thing is curiosity
                and a will and desire for personal growth. Simply wanting more
                fulfilment, improved mental wellbeing and a clearer
                understanding and energy for life is reason enough for
                committing to therapy.

                    best suited for you. Time after time the research shows that
                    the quality of the therapeutic relationship is more
                    important than the therapeutic modality used. Whatever the
                    approach, they all have the same focus – your best interests

                    The first session is an opportunity for us to meet and for
                    me to find out a little bit more about you and your
                    difficulties. First sessions last 60 minutes, sessions after
                    that will be 50 minutes long. I will ask several questions
                    to find out more about you and I may make a few notes with
                    your permission. This first session may feel different from
                    our ongoing sessions as these will be led by you.

                    opportunity to ask me as many questions as you need to feel
                    more comfortable. After the session you can take some time
                    to think about whether I am the right therapist for you. I
                    completely understand if you would prefer to work with
                    another therapist or if you decide that the time is not
                    quite right. The decision to start counselling and
                    psychotherapy can be a difficult one and therapy works best
                    when you feel ready.

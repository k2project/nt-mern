            <p>
                The GDPR states that I must have a lawful basis for processing
                your personal data. There are different lawful bases depending
                on the stage at which I am processing your data. I will explain
                these below:
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have had psychotherapy with me and it has now ended, I
                will use <b>legitimate interest</b> as my lawful basis for
                holding and using your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are currently having psychotherapy or if you are in
                contact with me to consider psychotherapy, I will process your
                personal data where it is necessary for the{' '}
                <b>performance of our contract</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GDPR also makes sure that I look after your sensitive
                personal information that you may disclose to me appropriately.
                This type of information is called ‘special category personal
                information’. The lawful basis for me processing any special
                categories of personal information is that it is for the{' '}
                <b>provision of health treatment</b> (on this occasion) and
                necessary for a contract with a health professional (on this
                occasion, a contract between you and me).
            </p>
        </>
    );

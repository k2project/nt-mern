                I sometimes share personal data with third parties, for example,
                where I have contracted with a supplier to carry out specific
                tasks such as a <b>private health provider</b>. In such cases I
                have carefully selected which partners I work with. I take great
                care to ensure that I have a contract with the third party that
                states what they are allowed to do with the data I share with
                them. I ensure that they do not use your information in any way
                other than the task for which they have been contracted.
            </p>
            <p>
                I may wish to liaise with other{' '}
                <b>professionals involved in your care</b> to ensure that an
                optimal care plan is in place for you. This will only be done
                with your consent.
            </p>
